# rob-watson-uk
The code for my actual website at http://rob-watson.uk
(yes, `http`, because I'm too cheap to pay for SSL)


## Key features:

1. Straight forward
> With a single point of entry, we just query a single database table to find
  a template file name and any additional data needed to display the template.
  Then we load it.
2. Fast
> With very little processing required, pages can be loaded really quickly.
  This needs to carry through to the templates themselves, which will also
  be as light-weight as posible.
3. Simple
> No autoloaders, no class heirarchy, just plain PHP code with minimal extra
  loaded in.


### Not included here:

* Content
> Templates will be generated by a back-end CMS and will include all required
  HTML to load a page.
* CSS
> CSS files are generated by SASS during deployments so are also not included
  in this repository.
* SASS
> SASS files are out of scope for this project.  I gave my own private
  deployment environment that manages these asssets
* Any HTML at all
> HTML skin files (headers, footers, etc) are out of scope for this project
  so are not included here.  I have my own private deployment environment
  to manage those assets separately.
